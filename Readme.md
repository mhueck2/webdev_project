README For webdev project: 

This is a personal website I built for CS 510 Intro to Webdev at Portland State University. 

It includes a bit of information about me and showcases 2 projects from classes I have taken so far (6/2022). 

The code was developed using the liveserver extension in vscode, and can be run locally that way. 

The site is hosted on github pages, at the link below:

Sources used: 'MDN web docs' for html, css, javascript documentation, and 'getbootstrap.com' for bootstrap documentation. Additionally I used our class textbooks, 'Eloquent Javascript' (Haverbeke) and 'HTML & CSS' (Duckett)
