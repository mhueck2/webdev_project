README For webdev project: 

This is a personal website I built for CS 510 Intro to Webdev at Portland State University. 

It includes a bit of information about me and showcases 2 projects from classes I have taken so far (6/2022). 

The code was developed using the liveserver extension in vscode, and can be run locally that way. 

The site is hosted on github pages, at the link below:
